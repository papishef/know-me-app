                    <li>Only two users can be in a room at a time, and for your privacy we advise that you only give out a room ID once and only when not within an active game session or after you have ended a session with a previous user.</li>
                    <li>To play with multiple users at a time, you can create several rooms in several browser windows with the same nickname</li>
                    <li>The idea behind the game is that a user picks a question of choice from the questions dropdown menu for the other user to answer, and vice versa.</li>
                    <li>You can leave the game at anytime and return to continue the session as long as you do not end the session manually</li>
                    <li>To end session manually, user is required to access an end button from the hamburger menu on the right of the chat screen, which deletes all messages history between current users</li>
                    <li>After session end, a result page with compatibility information and 2 cent advise is diplayed to help users make decision, if you require PlayRoom's advice.<span role="img" aria-labelledby="wink">ðŸ˜‰</span></li>
